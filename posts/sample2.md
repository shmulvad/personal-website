My second sample blog post. Here is another paragraph. This is getting kind of long now.

This is just another sample blog post. The blog post is written in **Markdown**. The following should be _italic_.

Hopefully we can also have lists:

- **Item 1**: Some important text
- **Item 2**: Some other important text

This is the end of the post.
