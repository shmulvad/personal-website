### Intro

I am studying my master's degree in Computer Science at the National University of Singapore (NUS) where I'm specialising in artificial intelligence. Besides computer science and AI, I take a great interest in math, economics and politics.

### Past

_I love to learn and build my own stuff!_ I've recently finished my bachelor's degree in Computer Science at the University of Copenhagen (UCPH) where I was specializing in data science. During my bachelor, I spent a semester abroad in Singapore where I fell in love with both the country, university and a particular girl. It also didn't take long before I knew I had to came back.

In my experience, creating high quality software requires a broad field of technological knowledge – from architecture and how the compiler translates your code to various aspects of back-end and how the end-user experiences the front-end. So besides my formal education, I also make sure to fill up my spare time with online courses, blogposts and reading books.

Before focusing a lot of my energy on Computer Science, I have also been very active in youth policy where I have had various positions of trust and in addition received professional education at the think tank CEPOS. Furthermore, I’ve finished compulsory military service and graduated high school at Risskov Gymnasium where I studied primarily mathematics and physics. The site you’re looking at right now is my personal website which is also an aggregator for some of my work.
